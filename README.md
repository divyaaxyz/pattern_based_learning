# pattern_based_learning (in progress)

Learning a language is a challenging task and it takes a lot of time for the learner to become fluent in a particular language. Learning a first language is somewhat easy, as we learn in an informal way and in an immersive environment. While learning a second language we adopt a formal way of learning, it challenges our mind requiring cognitive framework to understand and communicate in the target language. It requires conscious effort and time to develop language skills that may not come intuitively.

To address the challenges faced by language learners and expedite the learning process, one approach is pattern-based learning. We carried out 8 experiments on a group of people, harnessing the insights gained from prior experimentation, we propel the advancement of subsequent experiments and developed an algorithm in which repetition in the learning process strikes a balance between avoiding learner boredom and facilitating effective recall. This project further aimed to develop an intuitive and user-friendly web application so that learners can enhance their language acquisition process. It enables learners to identify and internalize patterns more efficiently, accelerating their progress and reducing the overall learning time required to achieve fluency.
